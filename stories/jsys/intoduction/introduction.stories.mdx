# JSYS Web Components

Jsys web components is a set of highly performant, accessible and flexible Web Components.
They provide an un-opinionated, white label layer that can be extended to your own layer of components.


## Demos

We do have a [live Storybook](/) which shows all our components.

**Please note:**


## Features

- High Performance - Focused on great performance in all relevant browsers with a minimal number of dependencies

> Note: These demos may look a little bland but that is on purpose. They only come with functional stylings.
> This makes sense as the main use case is to extend those components and if you do you do not want to override existing stylings.

## How to install

```bash
npm i @jsys/<package-name>
```

## How to use


### Use a Web Component

You can also use the jsys elements directly, although this is likely not a common use case.

```html
<script type="module">
  import '@jsys/form/input-field.js';
</script>

<input-field name="firstName"></input-field>
```


## Content

Jsys web components is logically organized in groups of systems.

The accessibility column indicates whether the functionality is accessible in its core. Aspects like styling and content determine actual accessibility in usage.
